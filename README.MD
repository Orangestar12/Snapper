#Snapper

##Description

Snapper is a program that will take a full screenshot of your computer screen and save it to a folder you specify for a given interval.

Snapper is great for Ludum Dare types and artists who want to make frame-by-frame videos of their work being developed.

##Usage

To use Snapper, simply begin the program . Enter the amount of time you would like Snapper to wait inbetween screenshots, use the "Change Directory" dialogue to select the folder you wish screenshots to be saved, and press "Start". You will recieve a notification each time a screenshot is saved.

##Notes

As of right now, Snapper requires an `options.xml` file to be saved in the same directory as it. In the future, it will create this file itself if it can't find it. However right now, it'll probably crash.

[If you have deleted `options.xml`, you can get a replacement here](https://github.com/Orangestar12/Snapper/raw/master/Snapper/bin/Release/options.xml).

##Downloads
